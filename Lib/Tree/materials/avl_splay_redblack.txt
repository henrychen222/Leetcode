(Splay Tree)  
is BST, main difference to AVL and Red-Black is Splay. Roughly balanced trees
benefits: quick access to frequently accessed items

(AVL Tree)
Is self-balancing BST,  heights difference of left and right subtrees at most one

(Red-Black Tree)
Is self-balancing BST, root and leaf are always black, no two adjacent red nodes
